Coin Problem

If we have eight coins
Coins are same except one
which is heavier than others
so how we find this coin in maximum two iteration

# Answer #
##########

'1' is heavier coin than others
coins = [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]

first we divide it into three equal subset if possible
either last subset will be smaller than others

## 1st iteration ##
one = [0,0,0]
two = [0,1,0]
three = [0,0]
compare one and two
as we see two is heavier than one
so split two into three subset

## 2nd iteration ##
one = [0]
two = [1]
three = [0]
compare one and two
one is heavier than two
so split one int two subset

### Found! ##
Bingo! we found Heavier coin in just two steps
two = [1] [1]
