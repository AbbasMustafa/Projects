Total Population: 200,000
Positives: 20,000
False Positive: 20%
False Negative: 30%

### How many are actually covid positive ##

1st we need to find out how many false positive are there.
False positive means wrongly indicated that particular condition is present
so we have to look inti postive patient to calulate this
false_positive = 20,000 * 0.2
false_positive = 4,000

So actual covid patient in positive list is only
actual_positve = 20,000 - 4,000
actual_positive = 16,000

But we need to calculate False negative as well
That how many false negative in those who are are detected as positive
False negative means that particular condition is present but not detected
So we have to look those people those are not detected as postive

Not_detectecd = 200,000 - 20,000
Not_detectecd = 180,000
actual_postive_in_not_detected = 180,000 * 0.3
actual_postive_in_not_detected = 54,000

So we need to add them both to find actual positive covid
actual_positive + actual_postive_in_not_detected
16,000 + 54,000
70,000
